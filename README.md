# 🧮 Simple Python Calculator

Welcome to **Erick's Simple Python Calculator** — a beginner-friendly command-line tool that performs basic math operations. This project was created as part of my learning journey during the **Power Learn Project (PLP)** Python module.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add two numbers
- ✅ Subtract one number from another
- ✅ Multiply two numbers
- ✅ Divide numbers (with smart handling of division by zero)
- ✅ Keep calculating until you choose to exit
- ✅ Clean, readable output
- ✅ Works with both whole numbers and decimals

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. You type in the **first number**.
2. You type in the **second number**.
3. You choose the **operation**: `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`.
4. The program calculates and shows the result.
5. You decide whether to calculate again or quit.

> Example:
```

Please type your first number: 10
Please type your second number: 2
Choose one: (+, -, /, \*): \*
10.0 \* 2.0 = 20.0

## 👨‍💻 Why I Built It

This was part of my **Week 1 assignment** at Power Learn Project. I used it to:
- Practice working with Python inputs
- Understand conditions (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Learn how to use loops (`while True`)
- Handle errors like dividing by zero
- Write clean and readable code

## 📚 Skills Gained

- Python basics
- Looping structures
- Condition handling
- Working with `float` numbers
- Creating interactive CLI apps
- Writing technical documentation (this README 😊)

## ✅ How to Run the Program

Make sure you have **Python 3 installed**, then:

1. Clone the repo from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Erickpython/python_Wk1-.git
````

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd <python_Wk1->
   ```
3. Run the calculator:

   ```bash
   python3 calculator.py
   ```
